# Project Name: Zimo - Twitter-Inspired Social Media Platform

## Description
Zimo was a project inspired by twitter, I developed it using HTML, CSS, Django, Python, and SQLite3 database. It includes basic functionalities such as posting, messaging, liking, commenting, and saving posts. It also includes a group chat feature called "Lobby" and allows users to follow and unfollow other users.

## Features
- **Posting**: Users can create and share posts, including text, images, and videos, with their followers and the wider community.
- **Messaging**: Users can send private messages to other users, allowing for direct communication.
- **Liking**: Users can like posts to show appreciation and support for content created by others.
- **Commenting**: Users can leave comments on posts to engage in discussions and share their thoughts.
- **Saving**: Users can save posts they find interesting or want to revisit later for easy access.
- **Group Chat (Lobby)**: Users can join group chats called "Lobby" to interact with other users in real-time.
- **Following and Unfollowing**: Users can follow and unfollow other users to customize their feed and interact with content from users they are interested in.

## Technologies Used
- Front-end: HTML, CSS
- Back-end: Django, Python
- Database: SQLite3

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/zimo.git```
2. Change to the project directory.
```cd zimo```
3. Install the required dependencies. (If you do not hve Django make sure to install the required Django and Python dependencies manually.)
```pip install django```
4. **SQLite** is the default database that comes with Django so unless you want to change it, just leave it the way it is
5. Start the Django development server.
```python manage.py runserver```
6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access Zimo, the Twitter-inspired social media platform.

## Usage
1. Sign up for a new account or log in with an existing account.
2. Explore the feed to view posts from other users.
3. Create a new post by clicking on the "New Post" button.
4. Interact with posts by liking, commenting, and saving them.
5. Send and receive private messages with other users.
6. Join group chats called "Lobby" to chat with other users in real-time.
7. Follow and unfollow other users to customize your feed and build a network of connections.

## Note
1. I had removed the ability to post cause I am working on a little change to the frontend
2. Removed the 'following' feed so now all that is in the  database shows on a user's feed
3. Still working on this from time to time so I might update every once in a while
